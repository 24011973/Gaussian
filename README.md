Gaussian Elimination
AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
Algorithm
Step 1:
Import the required libraries numpy and sys.

Step 2:
Input the size of the matrix n and define augmented matrix a as a NumPy array of size (n, n+1). Initialize the solution array x as a NumPy array of size n.

Step 3:
Perform forward elimination to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular form:

For each pivot row, ensure the pivot element is non-zero. Subtract multiples of the pivot row from the rows below to eliminate the elements below the pivot.

Step 4:
Perform backward substitution to compute the solution:

Start with the last variable and substitute back into the equations to find the remaining variables.

Step 5:
Display the solution values of all variables using formatted output.

Step 6:
Verify the results for correctness.

Program:


import numpy as np
import sys
n = int(input())
a = np.zeros((n, n+1))
x = np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected!')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i] / a[i][i]
                for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
x[n-1] = a[n-1][n] / a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    x[i] = a[i][n]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
        x[i] = x[i] - a[i][j] * x[j]
x[i] = x[i] / a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' % (i, x[i]), end=' ')
